# Brownian dynamics simulation of a coarse-grained bead and  spring polymer chain
The behaviour of dilute solutions of linear polyelectrolyte molecules is modelled by using the 
Brownian dynamics simulation technique. The mathematical polymer consists of a bead-and-spring chain with 
excluded volume that interact through a purely repulsive Lennard-Jones potential as well as through FENE 
spring forces. In this work, the final radius and radius of gyration have been calculated for different number of 
monomers.

r1279 or ran2 has been used to generate the random numbers. The use of high-quality random number generators, such as r1279.f or ran2.f, can improve the accuracy and reliability of simulations and calculations that rely on random numbers. These generators offer better statistical properties, longer periods and better suitability for parallel computing compared to the default random number generator provided by programming languages such as Fortran. In addition, the use of independent random number generators for different purposes, such as generating starting configurations or performing Monte Carlo sampling, can help to avoid correlations and biases in the generated number sequences.
